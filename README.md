When you run this updated script, it will prompt you to choose between three different modes: (1) practicing Hiragana to Romaji, (2) practicing Romaji to Hiragana, or (3) exiting the program.

If you choose mode 1, the script will randomly select a Hiragana character and ask you to input the corresponding Romaji equivalent. If you choose mode 2, the script will randomly select an English word (represented in Romaji) and ask you to input the corresponding Hiragana characters.

Note that this is still a very simple script and there are many ways to expand upon it or customize it to your needs. For example, you could add more vocabulary words, include a scoring system, or add a timer to increase the challenge.

Ascore variable and a total_questions variable are initialized to keep track of the user's progress. A start_time variable is also set to measure the elapsed time.

After each question, the score and total_questions variables are updated based on the user's answer, and the current score is printed. A timer is also displayed at the end of the program, showing how much time elapsed during the quiz.
